This Notion Template is the system I use every week to make YouTube videos. It's helped me gain 30,000 subscribers and 7,000,000 channel views.

Within each page of the template, I included notes to help you use it most effectively.

Some of the key features:

- a video ideas database + my idea generation/filtering framework
- a page to take down inspiration and ways to improve your videos (to get more views)
- shot list to manage b-roll
- script, description, and title template

My process is constantly changing and improving, so I will be keeping this template up to date (for free).
