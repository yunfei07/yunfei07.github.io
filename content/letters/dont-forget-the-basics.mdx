I was listening to a podcast last week that suggested reflecting on your "primary achievement" for every day.

Hearing this reminded me how valuable this frame was.

When I reflect consistently, it keeps my goals top of mind and primes my mind to make decisions in line with them.

When you're not paying attention it's easy to forget the basics.

A perfect example in my life is with personal finance.

I "already know" everything a book or video could tell me, but the more often I'm thinking about my financial goals, the easier it is to move closer to them.

My impressions video for the iPhone will be dropping in the next day or so, but it's definitely another weird year.
