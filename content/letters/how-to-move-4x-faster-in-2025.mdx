name: How to Move 4X Faster in 2025
description: Achieve more this quarter than most will this year.

Early last year I came across the book “The 12 Week Year” which talked about treating each year as 4 separate “years” to focus on a small number of short-term goals.

I’ve found that operating on quarters makes it easier to break down big goals for the year and have clear actions I can take each day.

This quarter I’ve set two goals for myself:

1. Ship a demo (10-15 minutes of gameplay) for my indie horror game
2. Finish my dashboard boilerplate - a full-stack web development project with everything i need to ship a new software project (authentication, stripe billing, etc.)

When you work on a ~12 week time horizon rather than 52, it forces a sense of urgency that you don’t feel with a yearly goal.

Weekly reflections become much more important and give you a clear overlook at how close you are to accomplishing your quarterly set of goals.

I’ve also found this makes me think a lot more deeply about what I want to focus on because 12 weeks *isn’t* that much time - I can only work on so many things at one time.

I hope this has been helpful and you give it a try.

## Things I’ve found interesting

*links to valuable stuff I thought was worth sharing*

[*The 12 Week Year: Get More Done in 12 Weeks than Others Do in 12 Months*](https://www.amazon.com/12-Week-Year-Others-Months/dp/B08DFFS7K8?crid=1POZWUFRP84N0&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.TMr5Otbg7meFnQed811T6epcVnNTiAovOulggBSNiidsKo-8ufhhZ9Jq0-24ZswX8-VE2tuXnsVPfJ9asDHAQCfDhJ41q2lMo4JcW3ebSHG71jf6XIsxcNUXafnpP9n5M3kFtpBMwQUWebWbrXcp4gK3LaRwXZ01li9RgCNfPsTay3HyjAsMX8dWTFFaoDgUeAtMO7QxSw5TVTWVPnkdh5YeyO8fhvHOe3RrLNQjSjk.DFiWXEucWSObIBi2PTOf5MWpDWa1dYpYMEO027-6oC4&dib_tag=se&keywords=12+week+year&qid=1736091535&sprefix=12+week+year%2Caps%2C203&sr=8-1) - I listened to the audiobook last year and found it very valuable.

[*Ghostty*](https://ghostty.org/) - A new terminal emulator I’ve been trying. It’s super fast and looks great.

[*Zed*](https://zed.dev/) - A new code editor that I came across. It’s written from scratch rather than being a fork of VSCode which I like. It’s still lacking in a lot of functionality but it looks promising.

[*Yaak*](https://yaak.app/) - A local-first API client. I’ve been looking for an alternative to Postman that’s lighter and works better offline and I think this is the one.

Have a great week.
