Learning a new skill or starting a business is hard.

The skill itself is likely difficult and you won’t know how to grow that business, but that’s not what makes it hard.

Continuing to focus and take action towards that one skill or business is difficult.

Not knowing what to do is rarely a good reason or the real reason that we don’t take action.

At a basic level, we all know _something_ we could do that moves us forward.

To learn how to code, you have to code. That means watching some tutorials and applying those learnings to a project.

Starting a YouTube channel means publishing videos.

Starting a startup means writing code and shipping it.

You understand how to make videos by making videos.

You learn to code by coding real apps.

Taking action is so powerful because action doesn’t care how feel.

If you continue to code, you will learn, even if you think it’s impossible.

If you continue publishing videos and improve something every time, you will grow.

You get better at taking action by reducing the amount of time between when you feel inspired and when you act on that inspiration.

If you get an idea for a new app, you are allowed to work on it today.

If you watch a YouTube video you want to replicate, you can record it today.

You don’t need permission to build things.

## If You’re Not Motivated to Code, Do This.

I made a video talking about how I’ve stayed motivated learning to code and building apps. This video is me talking to my younger self who’s struggling to stay consistent.

[_How I Made $50,000 Selling iPhone Wallpapers_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1JG44oACeo&t=1s) - A super inspiring video from Oliur. It just shows you how making something people want is a winning strategy.

[_Building the MVP for my startup_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ax85FI81ds) - I’ve been watching this guy Will’s videos for a couple months now an it’s a style of content I want to try. He’s showing the behind the scenes of building his startup in San Francisco.

[_How to Actually Make Money Online in 2025 - Case Study_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFdALGJ4dA) - A great interview of an ex-engineer who went full time with YouTube and a coaching business. What really stood out to me was how quickly this guy acted on ideas. He had heard about making skillshare classes as an income stream and released one that week.

Have a great week.
