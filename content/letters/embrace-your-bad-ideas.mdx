Coming up with ideas has always been something I’ve struggled with, whether it was for content or side projects.

Something I’ve learned recently is the power of writing down your _bad_ ideas.

I’ve started writing down ideas every night for a side project I can build to solve a problem I’ve recently experienced.

I write down whatever comes to my mind even if I know it sounds ridiculous.

The act of writing down an idea makes me more creative and I’ve already turned what was a bad idea into one that’s worth exploring.

When I have a list of hundreds of ideas, there’s bound to be a few that can be morphed into good ones.

## Things I’ve found interesting

_links to valuable stuff I thought was worth sharing_

[_How I Built A $30M Business Without A VC | David Heinemeier Hansson_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAFCvQtjZ7o) - an interesting conversation with the CTO of 37signals (created Basecamp). I enjoyed hearing his reasoning for keeping 37signals small (~50 employees) and not taking on investment.

[_Don't fall behind - High income skills worth learning_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRBAsdx9Ve0) - I always enjoy watching Oliur’s videos and this one i no different. All the skills mentioned in this video are great ones to focus on this year.

[_How To Get Customers So Fast It Feels ILLEGAL_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMzKk73iUhw) - A great video from Alex Hormozi. These videos are always crazy actionable.

Have a great week.
