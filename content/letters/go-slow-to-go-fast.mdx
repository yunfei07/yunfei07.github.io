A lesson I’m quickly learning as I’m building my first app while trying to stay consistent on YouTube is you must go slow to go fast.

It sounds simple and is probably a bit cliche, but it’s become painfully obvious for me recently.

My shift from mainly tech review type content to programming / almost productivity has been to provide more value.

I want every video to help somebody either be inspired to work on something they’re interested in or learn something they can immediately apply.

To make a video valuable, I first need to experience something worth sharing.

It’s easy to get on the hamster wheel of content and churn out videos to stay ‘consistent’, but doing this without regard to the substance of what you’re making leads to lower quality videos.

This applies to much more than just content, but it’s this area that it’s been especially apparent to me.

Taking a slower approach with content means spending more time programming so that I can make a video sharing something cool I’ve built.

This may mean going a week or two without an upload, trusting that the video it allows me to create is of a much higher quality.

When I took a month long break from content in the end of 2024 - early 2025, it reminded me of my passion for programming and led to some of my best performing (and high quality imo) videos in years.

This also leans into the concept of bottlenecks that I’ve learned are such an important aspect of growing a business.

Trying to solve two problems at a time, in my case YouTube constancy AND building a great product is difficult.

In order to build something great, I need to dedicate a lot of time and focus solely to it.

For a couple of months I’ve had a lot of opportunities for the YouTube channel so I went very hard on them.

There’s definitely merit to these periods of intensity, but there should be some regard to what the consequence is.

Meeting tight video deadlines meant sacrificing days of time coding the first version (MVP) of my app.

I got to a point where I was saying much of the same things in each video because I had exhausted my experience from the last couple of months.

I’m taking YouTube a bit slower the next month to focus on building Creator Kiwi and having interesting things to share about the experience.

I’ve had this gut feeling for a few weeks now that I should make this move, so maybe I’ll remember to trust it next time.

Have a great week.
