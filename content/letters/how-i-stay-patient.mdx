The trap I fall into when starting a new project is underestimating how much effort is required to build something great.

I’ll look at others work for inspiration and realize how much effort they put in.

This only feels bad when my expectation was to spend a few hours and have something worth sharing.

I create my best work when I’m in no rush to complete it and enjoy the entire process.

What helped me get consistent with YouTube was trusting that by putting in the work each week I would “succeed”, eventually.

I’ve had the goal to hit 100K subscribers since I’ve started and I still think I can hit it, but I’m in no rush.

This makes the process much more enjoyable because I’m not constantly stressing over the performance of each video.

I show up, talk about some tech I find cool, and move on to the next one.

I heard a quote this week that perfectly describes the mindset I want to adopt:

“Put your head down, do the reps, and it will all work out”.

## Setting Up a Windows Laptop for Programming

I’ve been testing the Dell XPS 14 recently and it’s pleasantly surprised me. The screen is gorgeous and the trackpad is the best I’ve seen from a Windows laptop. This made me want to configure it properly for development and I’m very happy with it.
