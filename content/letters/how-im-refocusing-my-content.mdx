name: How I’m Refocusing My Content
description: The advice I wish I heard when I started making videos.

In the last month I’ve been thinking a lot about what my vision for content is.

For the 4 years I’ve been making videos on YouTube, I’ve not spent much time thinking about the person who’s on the other side of the screen.

To make videos (or any content, really) that is valuable, you need a deep understanding of who you’re speaking to.

I’ve had the vague idea of ‘people who like tech’, but that’s not descriptive enough.

My recent pivot has been to talk much more about coding and how I use various tools to build things more efficiently.

I’ve broken down what I want my content to be in one sentence:

How to get the most out of tech & software to build things.

Thus, my target audience is other people who want to build things: engineers, students, or anyone who’s interested in programming

This came from thinking about what I enjoyed making the most, and what has performed the best.

A metric I’ve looked at for a while is the subscriber percentage - calculated as the # of new subscribers / video views

On average, this lands around .3% for what I consider a ‘good’ video.

This one in particular got 1.4%.

I looked back at very video I’ve made in the last 6 months and consistently, the videos related to programming brought in the most subscribers.

My theory for this is that my experience with a MacBook or other product from the context of building software is MUCH more unique than a random guy on the internet talking about his iPhone.

Because I have a clearer picture of who will be watching my video, the scripting and planning process becomes much easier.

I have a much stronger idea of what sorts of things the viewer expects and wants to see.

I’ve played around with a lot of themes and extensions in VS Code/Cursor, and talked about the best of them in this week’s video.
