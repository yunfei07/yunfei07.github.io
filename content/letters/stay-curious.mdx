A theme I’ve touched on in a few of my recent letters has been exploring your interests and curiosities.

This past week i’ve been teaching myself a new programming language (Golang) and it’s the most fun I’ve had with coding in a while.

This **is** a skill that can help me reach my future goals, but the reason I’m spending time learning it is purely out of curousoity.

I’ve found that when you focus on enjoying the process the results come by default.

By far the best reason to learn something new is you’ll be exposed to ideas you’ve never seen before.

I used to think if I thought hard or waited long enough a great business idea would come to me, but I’ve now realized to find unique problems to solve you have to expose yourself to new ideas.

Being curious is a superpower.

## Things I’ve found interesting

_links to valuable stuff I thought was worth sharing_

[_Crater University_](https://www.crateruniversity.com/?via=cole) - My friend Jordan is working on a free guide for becoming a self-taught software engineer. He landed his first role a few years back and is putting all of his knowledge into this. It’s launching soon but you can join the waitlist now to get notified.

[_How To Build A Complete JSON API In Golang (JWT, Postgres, and Docker)_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwZuNmAzaH8) - One of the videos I used to learn the basics of Go. It was super helpful to understand how to organize the project and build out an API.

[_I Discovered a New Sales Method to Close Deals Faster_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RVbvhPGFi6E) - An interesting watch from Alex Hormozi. He talks about how to reframe questions in a sales conversation to better understand what the other person is looking for.

[_How to Stay Focused and Beat Distraction - Nir Eyal_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbKo6aSc5mU) - A great podcast with Ali Abdaal and the author of ‘Indistractable’. They shared some very practical advice on how to prioritize your time and lessen distractions.

Have a great week.
