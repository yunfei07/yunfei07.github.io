I’ve been traveling a lot more than i typically do over the last couple of months and it’s forced me to adapt my routine.

I typically spread work on my YouTube videos over 6 days, starting on Monday and finishing Saturday afternoon-evening.

Generally, I script on Mondays, film from Tuesday to Thursday, and edit on Friday and Saturday.

This routine has worked well and been enjoyable, but it leaves little time for anything besides making videos outside of work and school.

Because I’ve been so dead set on dedicating work to an arbitrary day of the week, my work expands to fill the day.

When I have 6 days to work on a video I slowly work from Monday to Thursday and pick up speed when I realize it’s getting close to Sunday (when it goes live).

Having mid-week flights has forced me to film in just a day or two and finish editing over the following days.

Almost every video I’ve made for the last month has been finished a day or two early because I’ve realized I didn’t need as much time as I gave myself.

This has given me extra time to code and learn unreal engine, something I’ve wanted to try for years.

Having this extra time to relax and work on interesting projects outside of my normal work has made me feel more energized and creative.

## Tech purchases that improved my life

I try a lot of different tech for my channel but there’s a few items that save me time or make my life a bit easier.

[_MX Vertical Mouse_](https://www.notion.so/Productivity-a120167781ab43fa97076c65de89d475?pvs=21) - This takes some getting used to but it now feels a lot more natural than a normal mouse.

[_Unreal Engine 5 Beginner Tutorial 2024_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9qixi858Ag) - The UE5 course i’ve been watching. The two guys that teach it make it a lot of fun.

Have a great week.
