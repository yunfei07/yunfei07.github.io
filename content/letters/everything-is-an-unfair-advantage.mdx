Identifying your unfair advantages is a superpower you probably don’t know you have.

What might initially seem like a disadvantage can be turned into an advantage.

If you’re inexperienced in a skill, there’s little downside to trying to build something with it.

If you’ve never programmed before but decide to build a tool, the worst that happens is you learn a lot more than you already know.

You can use the curiosity of being a beginner to move quicker.

If you’re making your first content on YouTube, few people will see the worst of your early content, but you’ll be improving every time.

Finding the unfair advantages in everything you do is the simplest way to move faster and stick with it.
