I’m moving across the US from Buffalo, NY to the bay area.

I’ve always loved the area and wanted to live out there, but for the last few years it felt out of reach.

Moving there means much higher cost of living, knowing almost no one, and getting out of my comfort zone.

I almost didn’t make the decision.

I could have used one of many logical reasons *not* to move there.

I would save a lot of money and have more to invest.

I could pay off the (luckily low) debt I have from just finishing school much quicker.

I could be closer to family.

But for me, the benefits still outweighed any of these.

Driving around the area a couple of months ago felt right — there’s something about the atmosphere that’s so relaxing.

The concentration of people with similar goals building businesses is higher than anywhere else.

Despite the fear I felt, there was something inside of me that knew I had to make the decision.

The true turning point for me was the thought of “if I don’t do it now, I never will”.

I wasn’t willing to feel that regret 5 or 10 years from now.

I had to trust that feeling I had that this would increase the likelihood I win.

There’s only a few decisions like this you get to make in your entire life, so I wasn’t risking this one.

Maybe a year from now I’ll hate it and leave, but at least I’ll know it for sure.

Have a great week.
