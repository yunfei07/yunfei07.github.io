Making progress in business comes down to identifying your bottlenecks and eliminating them one at a time.

I’ve fallen into the trap too many times of focusing on several aspects of the business at the same time.

When you split your focus in an attempt to make everything a priority, nothing is a priority.

You can either do a lot of things kind of shitty, or one thing exceptional.

Identifying which area of your business is causing the most amount of pain and will have the biggest impact once it’s gone is the bottleneck to focus on.

You have to knock out bottlenecks one at a time, without getting distracted with ‘sexier’ opportunities.

Developing a better product, hiring talented help, or posting to a new social are all ways to grow, but you can’t try every one at the same time.

Your biggest bottleneck is the problem in your business that once solved will make everything else easier.

Solving a bottleneck means not starting anything new until it’s fixed.

Simply naming your bottleneck isn’t enough though, you have to break down what actions will solve it and do those during your most focused work time.

I’ve found that AI can be incredibly helpful with this as it forces you to think clearly about the problem, with the benefit that it can reveal your blind spots.

Have a great week.

P.S. My current bottleneck is I'm spending ~10 hours each week editing—I'm looking for a talented editor to free up this time. If you vibe with my content and have video editing skills, I'd love for you to <Link href="/jobs/video-editor">apply here</Link>.
