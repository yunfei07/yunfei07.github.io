name: What if You Actually Tried?

I think about this question a lot — “What if you actually tried”?.

Particularly when it comes to business.

I’ve known for years that the packaging of a YouTube video is massively important for its success.

Creating the thumbnail and title (at least the concept) should be the first thing you do because it ensures what you say is aligned with the packaging.

I only just started thinking about this in the last few videos, and they’ve been my best performing in a while.

We often know what we have to do to “win”.

I’m thinking more about this when it comes to building software.

I’ve put off building projects searching for the “perfect” idea, that of course doesn’t exist.

I’m brainstorming concepts for a content marketing tool that would useful for me.

I have a hypothesis for growing a software product like this one and making it valuable for others.

The biggest thing that has held me and many others from taking action on their ideas is fear.

Fear of failure, particularly in public.

A lot of us would rather silently fail so that we don’t have to feel the pain of embarrassment.

The idea of “build it and they will come” is a lie.

People have to find out about your stuff by you telling them about it.

Something I have to remind myself of is that nobody will remember the failures, and you only have to win once.

I’ve been having a lot more fun coding lately, so I put together all of the steps into a video. I had midterms so it’s a day or two delayed but I think this will be a valuable one.

## Things I’ve found interesting

_links to valuable stuff I thought was worth sharing_

["Distraction Is The Biggest Threat To Your Future" - Alex Hormozi (4K)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO5m-roVzjg) - Any podcast with Hormozi is gold but this one was what I needed to hear right now. My main takeaway is to reduce the delay between when you want to do something and when you actually do it.

[How I find $130K/month AI SaaS Opportunities hiding in plain sight](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibzSgp8B2Hw) - I love watching Greg Isenburg’s videos like these because they always get my creative juices flowing. The idea that every export button is a potential AI product idea is interesting.

[Dub.co](https://refer.dub.co/colecaccamise) (referral) - I use Dub for all of my shortlinks and it’s super good. They just updated my link so that you can get 20% off for 3 months

Have a great week.
