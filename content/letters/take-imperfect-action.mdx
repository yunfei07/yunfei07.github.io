When you’re starting something new you’re going to be bad at it.

The first time you design a website it will look off, and you won’t quite know why.

The first game system you develop will be janky, and your first YouTube video will be boring.

This is enough for most people to quit, but those that accept this as part of the process are the ones who win.

The more I learn about business and experts in various industries, the more I realize becoming good at anything is just doing it over and over again _consistently._

Over time your skills compound.

Concepts that would’ve taken months to grasp can be understood in a weekend.

I remember when I first started learning JavaScript I’d feel overwhelmed from the Udemy course I was watching and went weeks without touching it again.

When you start enjoying the work for itself and accept your outputs will be shit for now, real progress comes.

I’ve been developing games on the side for 3 months now, and while I’m not good at it, I’m enjoying it a ton.

I look forward to the hour I play around in unreal everyday, and that’s improved my skills more than anything else could have.

I’ve wanted to switch up my wallpapers for a darker vibe and had a new pack designed. I’ll be dropping these next week with a discount to everyone on the newsletter.

## Things I’ve found interesting

_links to valuable stuff I thought was worth sharing_

[_A horror game where you work the night shift at a diner..._](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTYBgOhpaEg) - The final project for my game development class was to create a ~10 minute gameplay video of what my team had been working on for the past couple months. I published it on my old gaming channel.

[_Zen Browser_](https://caccamise.link/zen) - I’ve been using Zen for the last month or so and they just launched a redesign this week. I’m really liking it.

[_Theft, Death, and Steve Jobs | FULL DOCUMENTARY_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fkK7_QEIJrg) - An insanely well done documentary on the handling of the leaked iPhone 4 from Jon Prosser/Front Page Tech. I’ve been loving his new style of content.

[_How to Build a Product III - Stanford CS183F: Startup School_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09GRs0FXdWQ) - A crazy actionable lecture from the co-founders of Docker, Plangrid, and Lob. They discussed exactly how they built their products from the ground up.

[_Andrei Herasimchuk - The 1st designer at Adobe_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-n7BJsjRCo) - A super interesting conversation about the early days of Adobe and what it means to be a good designer.

Have a great week.
