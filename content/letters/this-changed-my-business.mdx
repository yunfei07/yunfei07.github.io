One of the biggest unlocks I’ve had in business is realizing I can delegate the work I don’t want to do or I’m not good at.

I remember when I first heard about hiring assistants or an editor for my YouTube channel, it felt like something I wasn’t qualified for.

I felt that I had to be more ‘successful’ before I was ‘allowed’ to hire help.

Once I got over this feeling and hired my first freelancer, it opened up new possibilities in my business.

I’m not the best graphic designer, but hiring one means I can release more wallpaper packs.

Editing videos takes up a lot of my time, but I can pay someone to do it for me and get it back.

There’s a balance to this, just because something is hard doesn’t mean you should delegate it away.

It comes down to what tasks give you the highest leverage.

My video editing style is simple and it’s not the thing that moves my business forward.

Writing my scripts, though? That’s much higher leverage. It’s the voice and brand I portray.

It’s not always easy, but the outcomes I get from writing YouTube scripts or these newsletters are outsized.

In the beginning you don’t have the money to delegate, and that’s fine.

Start by mastering a skill enough to earn money from it. Then find someone better at it who can take it over, freeing you up to focus on what really drives your business forward.

Have a great week.

P.S. I’m looking for a creative video editor who truly understands my content. If you’re someone who has lots of ideas and wants to make sick videos alongside me, [apply here](https://caccamise.link/editor).
