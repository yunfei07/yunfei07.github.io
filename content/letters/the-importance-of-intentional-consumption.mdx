Something I’ve come to appreciate recently is what I call ‘intentional consumption’.

This menas choosing to watch a video, read a book, or even play a game in an intentional way.

Since I started making videos I’ve focused 80% of my time creating and the rest consuming.

This could be watching other tech videos or any piece of content that is interesting to me.

I often have the feeling that I shouldn’t bother seeing what other creators are doing and just spend my time creating, but this holds me back.

Taking the time to watch videos, even if it’s not directly applicable to what I create, makes me more creative.

Aside from content creation, this means deciding to watch/listen to a finance video instead of randomly scrolling Instagram.

I make decisions I’m happier with months later when I’m surrounding myself with ‘good’ influences.

Outside of simply pursuing goals, intentionally spending time playing a game is something I’ve not done often in years, but is enjoyable and relaxing for me.

I never regret something I do intentionally, whether that be playing a game or listening to a podcast while I eat lunch.

Social Media and Games are often demonized as ‘wastes of time’, but that’s only (in my opinion) if you’re doing it without thought.

This week I’ve put together my favorite recent tech purchases from Amazon. All of these are items that have made my life easier and are must-haves for me.

## Things I’ve found interesting

_links to valuable stuff I thought was worth sharing_

[_Millionaires In Cars Getting Coffee with @GrahamStephan_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3u2MpHKXhg) - This has become my favorite YouTube series with George from the Ramsey show. He takes a millionaire for coffee and asks them how they got there.

[_The only startup naming guide you’ll ever need: my proven framework_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jq_yw6jFOXk) - I had this video on while I was filming the other day and I had to stop to really take in what Greg (the creator) was saying. This is gold.

[_My Evidence Based Guide to Making Money Online [TIER LIST]_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wR8KoE8u1p0) - An interesting watch from Alex Hormozi. He talks about which social platforms have worked best for his business and the stats behind it.

Have a great week.
