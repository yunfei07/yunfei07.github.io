This week I started learning Blender so I could start modeling for my game project, and it reminded me that you can’t rush learning.

Blender is a complicated program that takes years of practice to get good with, and on day 2 I found myself wanting to skip ahead.

After an hour of struggling to model a character I could use for my game, I realized I didn’t know enough yet to do it right.

When learning anything new it’s easy to jump right into the exciting parts, but you have to get comfortable with the boring parts (the basics) and build a foundation first.

That principle applies to any skill you’re trying to learn or new business/side project you want to start.

Once you accept it going to takes years to get good, you can enjoy the process of getting there.

## Things I’ve found interesting

*links to valuable stuff I thought was worth sharing*

[_*CS50 Lecture by Mark Zuckerberg - 7 December 2005*_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xFFs9UgOAlE) - An interesting lecture from Mark Zuckerberg just a couple years into Facebook. He talked about the scaling issues they were running into and how even 20 years ago individuals had a ton of leverage from technology. 

[_*No BS Advice to Get Rich Like the 1%*_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDK4g5na4Jw) - Gold from Alex Hormozi.

[_*Beginner Friendly Blender Vids*_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOmYInaX-wE&list=PLzg4_2BrWAVwSyEgbgYGGflFefgtrmbay) - I've watched the first two videos of this playlist and they're gold. I've already learned so much.

[_*Residential Houses - Modular Pack*_](https://www.fab.com/listings/01d55fcd-24f2-418b-8723-91b212912257) - A sick pack for Unreal Engine to build houses with full interiors. Very useful and saves a lot of time.

Have a great week.
