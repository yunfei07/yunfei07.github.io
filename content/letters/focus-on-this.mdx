When you’re building a product, prioritizing the right things to focus on is difficult if it’s just you.

Having a second opinion when making decisions can be very helpful.

I was chatting with a friend about the first version (MVP) of Creator Kiwi, the revenue-tracking tool I’m building for YouTube creators, and how I could make it valuable.

At one point in our conversation, I had asked a question about when he thought it’s a good idea to invest in information, i.e. a course or consulting.

His response was a reminder I didn’t realize I needed:

"If you have a specific problem that is the bottleneck of your business and you need to have it solved and it will take you time to solve it, then I think it makes sense. But if that specific problem is not your current bottleneck, then I don't think that _at that time_ it is worth it to invest."

There’s a million things you can do at any one time that sound reasonable to do.

But the fastest way to make progress is focus on the single thing slowing you down.

My bottleneck is _not_ that I don’t have enough information - it’s that I’m not allocating enough focused effort towards building a useful product.

I know what I need to do, and anything else is a distraction.

As soon as you know the one action you can take every day to move close to your goal, ignore everything else and focus on it.

Have a great week.
