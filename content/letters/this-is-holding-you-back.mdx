We all have goals.

Some of us are more clearer on what they look like, but everyone has them.

The first step towards achieving them is identifying what actions are required to get there.

The second is to do enough reps of them without convincing yourself it’s a waste of time.

Identifying which step you’re stuck at is how you increase the likelihood that you win (eventually).

For years I was blurry on what “success” meant to me, and so knowing what actions I should be taking every day was unclear.

It’s impossible to make progress towards a goal if you don’t know which direction it’s in.

I love the concept of being “directionally correct”.

You don’t have to make the best decision, just one that’s in the direction of where you want to go.

If I know that I want to grow my YouTube channel, making videos on a consistent basis is directionally correct.

I could come up with a complex plan about coming up with viral ideas, or I could just be someone who makes YouTube videos.

Most people never make progress because they think they have to perfect the former plan.

The moment I decided that uploading one video per week (roughly) was my “strategy” is when I started growing.

Having a high level of clarity on what your goal is and what you have to do to get there is the 80/20.

Being stuck at step 2 is a much better place to be.

This is where you know that you should be uploading one video or building one feature of your side project every week, but you aren’t.

What’s helped me when I feel stuck here is zooming out 5 years down the line and comparing what my life would look like if I did and didn’t take consistent action.

More often than not this scares me into doing the thing.

If that doesn’t help, there’s two more questions you can ask yourself.

One is “what would this look like if it were fun”?

The second is “what am I afraid of”?

The former is a much easier problem the solve — I found that I enjoyed programming more than making YouTube videos, but I still wanted to make YouTube videos.

The more enjoyable version of my YouTube channel was one where I documented what I was building and shared things I learned.

Since making that shift I’ve had a lot more fun making videos and I’ve come up with better ideas.

If making the work more enjoyable doesn’t spring you into action, then you’re probably afraid of something.

It may be the fear of other’s judgement.

It may be the fear that you aren’t qualified enough to do the thing.

Whatever it is, identifying that fear is the only way to make progress despite it.

Getting rid of it isn’t the goal, it’s telling your fear to shut the f\*ck up and run towards it anyways.

Have a great week.
