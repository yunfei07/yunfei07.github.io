I listened to *The Almanack Of Naval Ravikant* this week and one of the biggest takeaways was around Naval’s approach to learning.

He constantly explores his genuine curiosities and will drop whatever he’s learning for something else if it no longer interests him.

I’ve been taking a similar approach recently with game development and it’s been the most fun I’ve had in years.

Exploring your genuine interests exposes you to perspectives you wouldn’t have otherwise found and gives you more interesting things to talk about.

Something as simple as playing around with Unreal Engine has given me a unique angle to talk about my experience with the MacBook from.

Along with learning what about what deeply intrigues you, detaching a timeline from “learning the skill” or monetizing it makes the process 10x more enjoyable (for me, at least).

I remember when I first started learning to code 7+ years ago I was so focused on “learning to code” that I skipped the basics and never applied anything to a real project.

You learn and retain information better when you use it to create something.

The process of taking an idea and figuring out how to progress as you go will teach you more than any book, course, or teacher ever could.

If you fall in love with the process the desire for the outcome is second to *doing the thing.*

## M4 Max Impressions

I’ll be releasing my first video on the M4 Max this week sharing my initial thoughts on the laptop. So far I’ve been very impressed and think this is the first year since the M1 Pro and M1 Max that it *might* make sense to upgrade.

## Things I’ve found interesting

*links to valuable stuff I thought was worth sharing*

[_*The Almanack Of Naval Ravikant*_](https://amzn.to/3YN02yG) - One of the best books I've read/listened to recently. It has a ton of valuable nuggets on building wealth, learning for its own sake, and happiness.

[_*The Presentation Secrets of Steve Jobs: How to Be Insanely Great in Front of Any Audience*_](https://amzn.to/3Z7qMLI) - A super interesting read on what made Steve Jobs' presentations so good.

[_*C++ Tutorial for Beginners - Learn C++ in 1 Hour*_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzaPdXTrSb8) - I've started to learn C++ to use in Unreal Engine alongside Blueprints (Unreal's visual scripting language) and this video has been super helpful to learn the basic syntax.

[_*Sleeve 2*_](https://replay.software/sleeve) - An app I've been using for a few months on my Mac that displays the cover art of the current song you're listening to with media controls.

Have a great week.
