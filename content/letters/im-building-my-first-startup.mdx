I can’t believe I’m saying this… but I’m building my first SaaS.

**Creator Kiwi** is your copilot for content marketing. It helps you make more of the _right_ content by showing you what has a measurable impact on your business.

Content is a black box. Views and likes don’t equal conversions and sales.

This is a product I desperately want, and I believe others will find it incredibly valuable.

I’m going to be documenting the journey of building this startup from scratch on this newsletter and YouTube.

I’m making this content for younger version of myself who knew this is what he wanted to do, but he never felt ready.

Writing this letter makes me feel like an imposter.

But that’s why it’s exactly the right thing to do.

2025 has been a year of getting out of my comfort zone, and this is just another example.

I believe organic content is the best way to let people know about your stuff (as Alex Hormozi would say), and I want to make measuring the impact much simpler.

If you’re interested, you can read the announcement post [here](https://creatorkiwi.com/blog/introducing-creatorkiwi). You can join the waitlist today to be notified when it’s available.

Have a great week.
