We live in a world where impatience is rewarded.

That reward only lasts a brief moment, then we crave another.

This applies to every area of life be it fitness, nutrition, or building a business.

We’ve gotten used to scrolling to the next TikTok when the current one is boring and ordering food when we don’t feel like cooking.

It creates this expectation that satisfaction is always a few clicks away.

I’ve been burned too many times in business unconsciously applying this same mindset.

Rushing out a YouTube video for the sake of uploading will harm your views.

Over-relying on AI when building a project leaves you with a mess of spaghetti code you can’t understand.

There’s never been a time where I’ve felt impatient while pursuing my goals and been grateful for the actions I took afterward.

I’ve found the most joy in growing my business when I realize it’s going to take a long time.

Taking my time to do things the ‘right’ way the first time has paid dividends.

I get a lot more enjoyment from making YouTube videos that provide value than ones that get a lot of views.

In building [Creator Kiwi](https://creatorkiwi.com/), spending the extra time to architect a clean solution has led to a codebase I feel more comfortable navigating.

I’ve taken the time to build modular systems within the app that make my life 10x easier when I have to build similar functionality.

The debt you accumulate from impatience will slow you down more than figuring out what to do in the meantime.

Have a great week.
