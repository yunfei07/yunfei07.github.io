When you’re starting to work on a new project, whether that be an app or a YouTube video, it’s very tempting to jump right in without planning the steps you should take.

I’ve found that a sufficient amount of thought put into your plan of action before starting produces a much better outcome.

Planning the title and thumbnail of your youtube video first will make it a more clickable concept.

I can’t tell you the amount of times I’ve worked on an entire video and then rushed to come up with packaging that made sense.

Those videos tend to perform much worse than one where I new what the title would be from the beginning.

In building my startup Creator Kiwi, I’ve realized I still don’t have a clear picture of the user flow front-to-back and what the SINGLE point of value is.

This is because I didn’t want to waste time _thinking_ about building a startup, I just wanted to _build a startup_.

The other extreme is not a better scenario, though.

If you spend _too much time_ planning you’ll feel productive for a while until you realize you’ve made no progress in weeks/months.

Clarity is the goal.

It’s a powerful feeling when you have it — you have a clear picture of where you want to go and the immediate path you have to follow.

Revealing it isn’t easy but the way I’m thinking about it is to spend just enough time planning the first few and last couple steps so that you can start taking action.

What’s especially important is to cut down scope.

If you’re starting a new YouTube channel or building an app, you first iterations aren’t going to be great.

What matters is that you have an idea of how to improve on your 100th iteration.

Have a great week.

P.S. If you’re currently building an app, reply with what you’re working on. I read every reply.
