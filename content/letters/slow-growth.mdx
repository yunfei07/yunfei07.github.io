I’ve always enjoyed making YouTube videos, but for years I’ve neglected pursuing other interests from the worry of ‘losing momentum’.

A couple months ago I decided to get rid of my upload schedule to make more time for other side projects.

Since then, I’ve never felt better.

Previously I’d wanted to work on various coding projects and learn Unreal Engine, but anything other than making videos felt outside of “what I should be doing”.

Taking YouTube slower means I can explore what I’ve always been interested in with programming and have more interesting things to talk about within my videos later.

We always here about the people who blew up in a month, but there’s something much more enjoyable about slow and steady progress.

There will probably be a time in the future I want to go harder on YouTube again, and I’ll be ready for it.

## M4 Max MacBook Pro Impressions

I picked up the M4 Max on Friday and so far I’ve been very impressed. I wanted to spend a few days with it before making my initial impressions video so expect this one in the next week. I’ve been using it in UE5 and it’s performing surprisingly well.

## Things I’ve found interesting

_links to valuable stuff I thought was worth sharing_

[_I'M BEING FOLLOWED by a Creepy Tall Woman in CROWDED Places.._](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-md9t1a7FDU) - A walkthrough of a super unique indie horror game. I always enjoy watching Hollow’s videos.

[_Reacting to My Subscribers’ Finances_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMiyFwvP-zk) - One of my new favorite video series on YouTube. Ramit Sethi is the author of “I Will Teach You To Be Rich” that is one of the most actionable books I’ve read. Highly recommend checking out his channel and looking at his “Conscious Spending Plan”

[\*Flow](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/flow-focus-timer-work-study/id1423210932)\* - A free Mac pomodoro timer I came across yesterday. It sits in the menu bar which I love.

[**_Zen Browser_**](https://www.ipqualityscore.com/free-ip-lookup-proxy-vpn-test/lookup/62.182.99.253) - A firefox-based browser focused on customization and privacy. I’ve been looking for something to replace Arc and this might be it.

Have a great week.
