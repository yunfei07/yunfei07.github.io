### Camera

[Sony a6400](https://caccamise.link/a6400) - The camera I use to film both A-roll and B-roll. I've had it for years and it works well.

[Screen Protector](https://caccamise.link/camera-screen-protector) (similar) - Works well and is super cheap.

[Sony 24-105mm F4 Lens](https://caccamise.link/24-105) - My main lens that I shoot on.

[Sigma 16mm f/1.4 Lens](https://caccamise.link/sigma) - Wide lens that I only use sometimes.

### Lighting

[Godox SL60W](https://caccamise.link/godox) - My main key light.

[Neewer Softbox](https://caccamise.link/softbox) - My softbox. A pain to set up but afterwards it works great.

[Light Stand on Wheels](https://caccamise.link/light-stand) - Moving my light around was always a pain but this makes it so much easier. Highly recommend.

### Mounting

[Smallrig Camera Cage](https://caccamise.link/camera-cage) - I used to use handles with this but don't much anymore.

[Neewer C-Stand](https://caccamise.link/c-stand) - Great for overhead shots.

[C-Stand Mounts](https://caccamise.link/c-stand-mounts) - I attach these to my camera so I can mount it to the C-Stand.

[Manfrotto Tripod](https://caccamise.link/tripod) (similar) - Lightweight tripod that's easy to move around.

[Manfrotto Fluid Video Head](https://caccamise.link/fluid-head) - The is a must have for video - lets you pan super smoothly.

### Accessories

[Rode Video Mic Pro](https://caccamise.link/rode-mic) - A great shotgun mic for when I need audio for a clip.

[SanDisk 1TB SD Card](https://caccamise.link/sd) - Lots of storage. Too bad I snapped it in half (don't ask me how).

[Battery Charger Kit](https://caccamise.link/battery-charger) - This has been giving me issues recently but when it works it's convenient.

[Rocket Air Blower](https://caccamise.link/rocket) - Love having this for cleaning out dust.
