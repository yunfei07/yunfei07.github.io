[Raycast](https://raycast.com/?via=cole) - One of my favorite Mac apps. It's a spotlight replacement that gives you access to systems commands and tons of other tools with extensions.

[Raycast Pro (1 Month Free & 10% Off)](https://caccamise.link/raycast-pro) - The pro subscription gives you access to a few different features, but my favorites are Quick AI and Cross-Mac syncing.

### Extensions
