### Apps

[Cursor](https://caccamise.link/cursor) - Cursor is a fork of VSCode with Claude built-in. I find the AI is a lot better than GitHub Copilot. They keep it up to date with the latest versions of VSCode so any extension should work perfectly.

[Warp](https://caccamise.link/warp) - My main terminal app. I switched from iTerm2 and like it a lot better. It has AI built-in which is great in case I forget a command. The autocompletion is also really good.

[Arc](https://caccamise.link/arc) - My browser of choice. I love the sidebar design and having different spaces. It's built on top of Chromium so any Chrome extension is compatible.

[Raycast](https://raycast.com/?via=cole) - So much more than a spotlight replacement. Raycast integrates with a ton of tools and lets you take control of your entire mac from your keyboard. Things like changing output devices and clipboard history are super convenient.

[Linear](https://linear.app) - Primarily a team-based project management tool but it's still great for personal projects.

### Languages/Frameworks

[Next.js](https://nextjs.org) - I use Next as the frontend for all of my projects. Its server-side capabilites make it great for SEO and with small apps a separate backend may not be necessary.

[Go/Golang](https://go.dev/) - Go is a clean and performant programming language I use for writing backend APIs. The standard library gives you a lot of the functionality you'll need.

[Chi](https://go-chi.io/) - A lightweight router for building Go HTTP services. It's built on the standard library and makes writing APIs a little simpler.

[TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com) - A utility-first CSS framework. It's easy to pick up and makes building UIs super fast.

[HeadlessUI](https://headlessui.com) - UI Components built with Tailwind. Really useful for dropdown menus.

[shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com) - When I need a UI component I don't want to build myself I go here first. Lots of great ones that are easy to integrate with.

### Services

[Vercel](https://vercel.com) - Where I host all of my frontend projects. By far the easiest way to host Next.js and take advantage of Vercel's features (like edge functions and storage).

[Railway](https://caccamise.link/railway) - Where I host my backend services.

[Supabase](https://supabase.com) - The PostgreSQL database I use for all of my projects. It's easy to build with and they handle auth with minimal setup.

[Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3) - Where I store all media files very cheaply.

[Amazon CloudFront](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/) - The CDN I put in front of my S3 buckets to speed up delivery.

[Resend](https://resend.com) - How I send emails within my apps. Setting it up takes minutes and their Next.js & Golang SDKs are great to work with.

[React Email](https://react.email) - A collection of React components to design emails. It's maintained by Resend so it integrates nicely.

[Kit](https://kit.com) - The platform I use to send my weekly newsletter. I'm using their API to have custom signup forms on my website.

[Dub.co](https://caccamise.link/dub) - What I use to create shorten and track my links (<Link href='https://caccamise.link/'>caccamise.link</Link>). They also have a powerful API/SDK that is great if you need to implement link sharing in your app.

[Plausible](https://plausible.io) - Privacy-focused analytics that are super powerful.

[Cloudflare](https://cloudflare.com) - I use their free plan to protect against DDoS attacks and manage my DNS settings.

[Lemon Squeezy](https://lemonsqueezy.com) - Where I currently sell my digital products. They handle global tax compliance which saves me a lot of headaches.

### Domains

[Porkbun](https://porkbun.com) - Where I buy almost all of my domains.

[Namecheap](https://namecheap.com) - Any TLDs that aren't available on Porkbun (like .so) I usually look here.

[One Word Domains](https://caccamise.link/domains) - A database of available short domains under lots of TLDs.

### Resources

[Refactoring UI](https://www.refactoringui.com) - A great eBook about UI design written by the creators of TailwindCSS that I think is worth a read. It's super actionable and taught me a lot of best practices.

[Full Stack Web Development Udemy Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-web-developer-bootcamp/?couponCode=LEARNNOWPLANS) - When I got serious about learning this is the course I went through. I've only done the front-end portion but the instructure, Colte, is great at explaining things. Highly recommend this course for beginners.

[React/Next.js Udemy Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-ultimate-react-course) - Jonas is my favorite instructor, and his React course is phenomenal. He covers all of vanilla React and a few sections on Next.js that were super helpful when I got started with next.

[Traversy Media](https://www.youtube.com/@TraversyMedia) - My favorite programming YouTube channel. Brad's a great guy and his crash courses are the first place I go whenever I learn a new technology.
