[Cursor](https://caccamise.link/cursor) - I just started using Cursor, which is a fork of VSCode (all extensions still work) with Claude built-in. So far I'm finding it a lot more useful than Copilot.

### Theme

[“Minimal” theme](https://vscodethemes.com/e/nichabosh.minimal/minimal) - Simple and clean.

[Glyph for vscode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=lewxdev.vscode-glyph) - I use the “Legacy” version

[Material Product Icons](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=PKief.material-product-icons) - I like them better than the default ones.

### Extensions

[Auto Rename Tag](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=formulahendry.auto-rename-tag)

[Dotenv](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dotenv.dotenv-vscode) - This extension keeps your env files synced across machines.

[Postman](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Postman.postman-for-vscode) - Test APIs without leaving the editor.

[Draw.io](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=hediet.vscode-drawio) - Great for creating diagrams within VSCode.

[Figma](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=figma.figma-vscode-extension) - View any figma file within VSCode. You can even copy the code if you have a pro subscription.

[GitLens](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=eamodio.gitlens) - Makes it easy to see who made changes throughout a file. I still like having it for solo projects.

[Project Manager](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=alefragnani.project-manager) - Quickly jump between projects.

[Remote Explorer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.remote-explorer) - Great if you work with VMs often.

[Tailwind CSS IntelliSense](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bradlc.vscode-tailwindcss) - Convenient autocomplete and lets you see the raw CSS for each Tailwind class.

[Todo Highlight](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=wayou.vscode-todo-highlight) - Highlights TODOs and FIXMEs so they're easier to find.

[WSL](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-wsl) - Allows you to open a folder in WSL. Must-have when working on my windows machine.

### MacOS Icon

<Link
  className="btn btn-contrast w-fit text-app-bg"
  href="https://assets.colecaccamise.com/stack/vscode/vintage-vscode.icns"
>
  <span className="text-app-bg">Download Vintage VSCode Icon</span>
</Link>

How to change icon:

1. Hold <kbd>⌘</kbd> and click VSCode in your dock
2. With it now revealed in Finder, select it and hit <kbd>⌘ + I</kbd>
3. This opens up the info about VSCode, just drag the .icns file into the icon preview in the <b><u>top left</u></b> corner (next to 'Visual Studio Code' text)
4. Open your terminal app (I recommend [Warp](https://caccamise.link/warp)), type in `killall Dock` — this restarts the Dock and shows the updated icon
