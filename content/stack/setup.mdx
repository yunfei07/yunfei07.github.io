### Desk

[IKEA Karlby](https://caccamise.link/karlby) - a sturdy countertop.

[Flexispot Standing Desk (similar)](https://caccamise.link/standing-desk) - I've been using these legs for a few years now, no complaints.

[Herman Miller x Logitech G Embody](https://caccamise.link/embody) - This is a fantastic chair. It's expensive but you get what you pay for. Definitely worth it if you work at a desk all day.

### Audio

[Audioengine HD3 Speakers](https://caccamise.link/hd3) - A great set of desktop speakers. The bass isn't great but they sound incredible for their size.

[Beyerdynamic DT 990 Pro Headphones](https://caccamise.link/dt-990) - I absolutely love these headphones. The open back design gives a very natural sound, though you'll hear everything around you.

[Focusrite Scarlett 2i2](https://caccamise.link/focusrite) - I've used this audio interface for years with no problems. I wrapped it with some carbon fiber vinyl wrap I found on Amazon to cover the red design.

[Audient Evo 4 Interface](https://caccamise.link/evo) - I personally recommend this interface if you're in the market. Looks great and the volume knob is super nice.

[Shure SM7b](https://caccamise.link/sm7b) - A classic microphone, it's what I use for all my voiceovers. Sounds great.

[Cloudlifter](https://caccamise.link/cloud) - Basically have to get this if you use the sm7b.

[Shure MV7](https://caccamise.link/mv7) - Probably the mic I'd recommend to most people who want great quality audio. A bit cheaper than the SM7b and doesn't require an interface (though I use one with it).

[Elgato Wave Mic Arm](https://caccamise.link/elgato-wave) - This thing looks sleek. It doesn't tighten super well though.

### Monitor

[LG 38" Ultrawide](https://caccamise.link/ultrawide) - The single monitor I use in my workspace. I absolutely love the screen real estate it gives me. Can easily have 3 windows open at once.

[Monitor Arm](https://caccamise.link/monitor-arm) - Gives my monitor a floating effect and makes it easy to adjust the height/position.

[Benq Screenbar Halo](https://caccamise.link/halo) - A bit expensive but a nice way to keep my desk lit up throughout the day/night.

### MacBook

[14" MacBook Pro M3 Pro](https://caccamise.link/m3-pro) - My current daily driver. This is what I edit, code, and design on.

[Caldigit TS4 Dock](https://caccamise.link/caldigit) - The TB4 dock I use with my Mac. This is how I hook up to my monitor, speakers, and other accessories.

[Rain Design MacBook Stand](https://caccamise.link/mac-stand) - I like having this to keep my Mac's lid open and use it as an extra display.

### Peripherals

[Logitech MX Keys Mini](https://caccamise.link/keys) - I'm usually a fan of mechanical keyboards but I've been using this daily for over a month and I love it.

[Logitech MX Anywhere 3S](https://caccamise.link/anywhere) - A small mouse that's simple and comfortable to use.

[Carrying case for MX Anywhere](https://caccamise.link/anywhere) - This is great to have when traveling as I can just clip the mouse onto my bag.

[Deltahub Carpio](https://caccamise.link/carpio) - A wrist rest for your mouse meant to reduce wrist strain. It's expensive for what it is but I like having it around.

[Nordik Desk Mat](https://caccamise.link/mat) - A great desk mat for the price. It's not real leather but looks great.

### Accessories

[Model Porsche GT2 RS](https://caccamise.link/gt2-rs) - A reminder of my goals throughout the day ;)

[Amazon Echo Spot](https://caccamise.link/spot) - My favorite desk clock. Love having this to quickly glance at the time and see the current weather conditions.

[Desk Lightstrip](https://caccamise.link/lights) - A cheap lightstrip I found on Amazon that works with Alexa. It's only white (can set it cool-warm) but I much prefer that over RGBs.

[Vivo Cable Tray](https://caccamise.link/cable-tray) - An easy way to manage my cables. I just have this attached with command strips.

[Wooden Valet Tray](https://caccamise.link/valet) - I like to keep my keys, wallet, etc. in here.

[Physical Timer](https://caccamise.link/timer) - This is great to stay focused with.

[Physical Todo Cards](https://caccamise.link/planner) - An analog productivity system. I don't use them all the time but I like having them.

[Wooden Pen Holder](https://caccamise.link/pen-holder) - A small quality of life improvement.

[Under Desk Drawers](https://caccamise.link/drawers) - These are super convenient to hold things I don't always want on top of the desk.

[xBloom Coffee Maker](https://caccamise.link/xbloom) - The most aesthetic coffee maker I've seen. Works well.
