[Alienware 32" 4K 240 Hz Monitor](https://caccamise.link/alienware) - The best monitor I've ever gamed on. The picture quality is fantastic and the refresh rate is insane for games that can push it.

[Lian Li O11 Dynamic Mini](https://caccamise.link/pc-case) - I've used this case for a couple of years now and like it. Always has been easy to build in.

[RTX 4080 Gigabyte Eagle OC](https://caccamise.link/4080) - An overpriced but powerful card. Runs RT at 100 FPS w/ DLSS 3 in most titles.

[i7 13700K](https://caccamise.link/13700k) - This could probably use an upgrade but I haven't had any issues.

[Kraken 280mm Cooler](https://caccamise.link/kraken) - I've had the x62 since I built my first PC in 2019. It still runs well.

[Lian Li Fans](https://caccamise.link/fans) - These look great with the O11.

[Spider-Man Funko](https://caccamise.link/future-foundation) - Your friendly neighborhood funko pop.

[MSI Motherboard](https://caccamise.link/motherboard) - Sleak design. It's a motherboard.

[Trident Z Royal RAM (32GB)](https://caccamise.link/ram) - Gorgeous RAM.

[1000W SFX PSU](https://caccamise.link/psu) - One of the few SFX PSU's with this capacity.

[1TB Intel SSD](https://caccamise.link/intel-ssd) - Great value-for-money M.2.

[1TB Samsung SSD](https://caccamise.link/samsung-ssd) - A fast drive.

### Games I'm Playing

[Deadlock](https://colecaccamise.com/deadlock) - A new multiplayer MOBA game from Valve. It's a lot of fun.

[Life is Strange: Double Exposures](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1874000/Life_is_Strange_Double_Exposure/) - The original Life is Strange is in my top 5 games of all time so I'm excited for this one to launch.

[Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2138330/Cyberpunk_2077_Phantom_Liberty/) - I was a huge fan of the base game and this DLC makes it even better.

[Black Mesa](https://store.steampowered.com/app/362890/Black_Mesa/) - A remake of the original Half-Life. It's really well done and fun to play.

[Fears to Fathom: Home Alone](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1671340/Fears_to_Fathom__Home_Alone/) - I recently came across the Fears to Fathom series and I love the atmosphere. It's also one of the scarier games I've played.
